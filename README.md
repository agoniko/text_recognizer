# text_recognizer
This is my first project of computer vision, here i'm trying to convert a text seen on an image to a string readable by our PC's.
Unfortunately i thought that the task was harder but the solution was very simple, however theese are the results.

You can notice that the library recognize very well an image with written-on-pc text but performs poorly with some handritten text.



## Handwritten texts

### first image
![first_text_image](resources/img/img1.jpg)

#### ouput of the script
Ne Stoet With Good

Because all businesses should
be ses pessoa: bees


### second image
![first_text_image](resources/img/img2.jpg)

#### ouput of the script
LA Ss if Wed, nesdoy

We had m pood
Team building

## written-on-pc text

### third image
![first_text_image](resources/img/img3.png)

#### ouput of the script
1 Heading on Level 1 (section)

Hello, here is some text without a meaning. This text should show what a
printed text will look like at this place. If you read this text, you will get no
information. Really? Is there no information? Is there a difference between
this text and some nonsense like not at all! A blind text like this gives you
information about the selected font, how the letters are written and an im-

pression of the look.




# Note
If you want to try the script you have to install the .exe file of the tesseract library at  https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
then put it in the parent folder of your project.
